## Financial Analysis Techniques

- Financial Analysis involves:
 - Step 1: State the objective and context

 - Step 2: Gather Data

 - Step 3: Process the data

 - Step 4: Analyze and interpret the data

 - Step 5: Report the conclusions or recommendations

 - Step 6: Update the Analysis

- Financial Data Visualization
 - Step 3 of Financial Analysis Techniques


`@script`
State the objective and context: Determine what questions the analysis seeks to answer, the form in which this information needs to be presented and what is the number of resources and the duration of time available to perform the analysis.

Gather data: Acquire the company's financial statements and other relevant data on its industry and the economy. Ask questions of the company's management, suppliers and customers and visit company sites.

Process the data: Make any appropriate adjustments to the financial statements. Calculate ratios. Prepare exhibits such as graphs and common-size balance sheets.

Analyze and interpret the data: Use the data to 
answer the questions stated in the first step. Decide what conclusions or recommendations the information supports.

Report the conclusions or recommendations. Prepare a report and communicate it to its intended audience. Be sure the report and its dissemination comply with the Code and Standards that relate to investment analysis and recommendations.

Update the analysis: Repeat these steps periodically and change the conclusions or recommendations when necessary.

## Let's Practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "b75911568f"
```

`@script`
Now, it's your turn. Let's roll up your sleeves, conduct Step 3 of financial analysis and practice the techniques we've mentioned. At the end of the exercise, we will also conduct step 4 and 5 of financial analysis, i.e. Explore and interpret through the visualization of the copper/gold ratio relationship using Matplotlib.
