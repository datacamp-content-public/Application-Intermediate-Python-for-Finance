## Financial Analysis Techniques

- Financial Analysis involves:
 - Step 1: State the objective and context

 - Step 2: Gather Data

 - Step 3: Process the data

 - Step 4: Analyze and interpret the data

 - Step 5: Report the conclusions or recommendations

 - Step 6: Update the Analysis

- Financial Data Visualization
 - Step 3 of Financial Analysis Techniques


`@script`
There're 6 main steps in financial analysis:

State the objective and context
Gather data
Process the data

Analyze and interpret the data

Report the conclusions or recommendations.

Update the analysis
This Chapter mainly focus on Step 3 i.e. how to visualize financial data

## Financial Data Visualization

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "e5d46b3b3d"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
## Disciplines:

- Fundamental Analysis
 - Trends (e.g. sales growth, EBITDA, etc)
- Technical Analysis
 - Price Chart (e.g. stock price, volume, etc)
- Quantitative Analysis
 - Statistical Relationship (e.g. distribution, correlation, etc)


`@part2`
## Common Financial Python Library:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

- Boken

- Pygal

- Geoplotlib


`@script`
In finance, analysis can mainly divided into 3 groups: fundamental, technical, quant, etc..

Regardless of which discipline, modern practitioners use various python libraries to quantify and visualize financial data. Common financial python library includes Matplotlib, seaborn, bone, pygal, geoplotlib.

In the coming chapter, we will focus on the first two.

## Matplotlib

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "71f601c5f6"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
### Common Graph 
Line Plot
,Histograms
,Pie Chart, etc.

### importing matplotlib
`import matplotlib as mpl`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

### Example: Candle Stick Analysis
`from matplotlib.finance import candlestick2_ohlc`

`@script`
Most of you by now has use Matplotlib to conduct visualization in Python. 
Like other discipline, in finance, analysts and practitioners use common chart such as Line Plot, Histograms, pie chart, bar chart and so on to visualize financial data such as stock price trend, sales trend, index constituents breakdown etc.. 

In the following lessons, we will explore some of the unique modules in Matplotlib that are used by practitioners. 
One of them is to plot price trend as candlestick, an important chart presentation for traders and analysts to conduct technical analysis. 

In order to use the Matplotlib library and the candlestick features, one has to import the following code.

## Seaborn

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "857a427ebe"
```

`@part1`
### importing seaborn
`import seaborn as sns`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

### Pairplot
`sns.pairplot()`


### Heatmap
`sns.heatmap()`


`@part2`

`@script`
Apart from Matplotlib, Seaborn has commonly been used in the industry in recent years due to the clean and simple lay out.

Seaborn is a data visualization library that builds on matplotlib; it has a wide variety of the plots and techniques for advanced visualization. 

In the following lessons, we will utilize the Seaborn library to enhance our technical analysis.

## WHAT IS COPPER/GOLD RATIO

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a8da883d0d"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- Copper
 - Industrial metal with many uses (e.g. Building Construction)
 - Barometer of Econ. Growth
- Gold
 - Safe-haven Investment
 - Barometer of Econ. Slowdown 
- Ratio Calculation
 - Dividing the Copper Price by the Gold Price

`@script`
Copper is a key industrial metal that is used globally in a wide range of industrial applications it performs strongly when the global economy is doing well. This makes it a leading indicator of global economic health.

Gold is the exact opposite, It is the most widely recognized safe-haven asset among investors. Therefore, during times of economic and geopolitical distress it generally tends to perform well, making it a leading indicator of fear. 

The copper-gold ratio acts as an accurate barometer of global growth...In coming exercises, you will learn how to visualize this ratio relationship with the use of Matplotlib & Seaborn.

## Let's Practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "b75911568f"
```

`@script`
Now, it's your turn. 

Let's roll up your sleeves, conduct Step 3 of financial analysis and practice the techniques we've mentioned. 

Explore and interpret through the visualization of the copper/gold ratio relationship using Matplotlib.
