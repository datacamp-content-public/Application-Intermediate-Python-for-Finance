## Financial Analysis Techniques

- Financial Analysis involves:
 - Step 1: State the objective and context

 - Step 2: Gather Data

 - Step 3: Process the data

 - Step 4: Analyze and interpret the data

 - Step 5: Report the conclusions or recommendations

 - Step 6: Update the Analysis

- Financial Data Visualization
 - Step 3 of Financial Analysis Techniques


`@script`
State the objective and context: Determine what questions the analysis seeks to answer, the form in which this information needs to be presented and what is the number of resources and the duration of time available to perform the analysis.

Gather data: Acquire the company's financial statements and other relevant data on its industry and the economy. Ask questions of the company's management, suppliers and customers and visit company sites.

Process the data: Make any appropriate adjustments to the financial statements. Calculate ratios. Prepare exhibits such as graphs and common-size balance sheets.

Analyze and interpret the data: Use the data to 
answer the questions stated in the first step. Decide what conclusions or recommendations the information supports.

Report the conclusions or recommendations. Prepare a report and communicate it to its intended audience. Be sure the report and its dissemination comply with the Code and Standards that relate to investment analysis and recommendations.

Update the analysis: Repeat these steps periodically and change the conclusions or recommendations when necessary.

## Matplotlib

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "71f601c5f6"
```

`@part1`
### Common Graph 
Line Plot
,Histograms
,Pie Chart, etc.

### importing matplotlib
`import matplotlib as mpl`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

### Example: Candle Stick Analysis
`from matplotlib.finance import candlestick2_ohlc`

`@script`
Most of you by now has use Matplotlib to conduct visualization in Python. Like other discipline, in the financial industry, analysts and practitioners use common chart such as Line Plot, Histograms, pie chart, bar chart and so on to visualize financial data such as stock price trend, sales trend, index constituents breakdown etc.. In the following lessons, we will explore some of the unique modules in Matplotlib that are used by practitioners. One of them is to plot price trend as candlestick, an important chart presentation for traders and analysts to conduct technical analysis. 

In order to use the Matplotlib library and the candlestick features, one has to import the following code.

## Seaborn

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "857a427ebe"
```

`@part1`
### importing seaborn
`import seaborn as sns`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

### Pairplot
`sns.pairplot()`


### Heatmap
`sns.heatmap()`


`@part2`

`@script`
Apart from Matplotlib, Seaborn has commonly been used in the industry in recent years due to the clean and simple lay out.
Seaborn is a data visualization library that builds on matplotlib; it has a wide variety of the plots and techniques for advanced visualization. In the following lessons, we will utilize the Seaborn library to enhance our technical analysis.

## WHAT IS COPPER/GOLD RATIO

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "a8da883d0d"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- Copper
 - Industrial metal with many uses (e.g. Building Construction)
 - Barometer of Econ. Growth
- Gold
 - Safe-haven Investment
 - Barometer of Econ. Slowdown 
- Ratio Calculation
 - Dividing the Copper Price by the Gold Price

Gold is the most widely recognized safe-haven asset among investors. Therefore, during times of economic and geopolitical distress it generally tends to perform well, making it a leading indicator of fear. 
Copper is the exact opposite. Because it is a key industrial metal that is used globally in a wide range of industrial applications it performs strongly when the global economy is firing on all cylinders. This makes it a leading indicator of global economic health 

The ratio copper-gold ratio acts as an accurate barometer of global growth...

key: "b75911568f"
```

`@script`
Now, it's your turn. Let's roll up your sleeves, conduct Step 3 of financial analysis and practice the techniques we've mentioned. At the end of the exercise, we will also conduct step 4 and 5 of financial analysis, i.e. Explore and interpret through the visualization of the copper/gold ratio relationship using Matplotlib.
